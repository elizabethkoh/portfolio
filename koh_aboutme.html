        <p class="tab wrap">Welcome to my website! I am Elizabeth Koh, a freshman at Dublin High School who would like to pursue a career in web design. Currently, I am taking Computer Science Principles, an introductory Project Lead the Way (PLTW) course that teaches students the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, among other languages. For as long as I can remember, I have always had a certain passion for design, and upon enrolling in this course, I have discovered a love for the wide opportunities that HTML and CSS provide. From attending Digitize Hackathon II in San Francisco to learning the foundations on Codecademy, as well as receiving help from some of my personal mentors, I have found that working in web design would allow me to combine my talents and passions into a meaningful profession, while also enabling me to continue learning and applying that knowledge.</p>
        <p class="tab wrap">My path of self-discovery expanded when I entered middle school, with its vast array of new opportunities. In my first year, I decided to enter a singing competition with a friend, and despite both of us being shy and nerdy, we placed first. This experience played a vital role in quelling my anxieties and opening me up to trying new things. I joined Color Guard, and found a loving family and another passion, later becoming the Captain in my eighth grade year. In seventh grade, I took a leap of faith and, along with a friend, decided to run for Associated Student Body (ASB) Office, and again surprised myself by being elected. My experience as an Officer was eye opening, leading my peers while still working alongside them, and overseeing many events. As the Dance Commissioner, I directed work to prepare for these dances, and eventually became the Lead Coordinator of the same singing competition which I had won in sixth grade. As Captain of our Color Guard, I was in constant communication with my team and our band director, and had my name engraved on a plaque because of my hard work and dedication. When we graduated, our leadership teacher chose me and another officer to give speeches at the ceremony, and I spoke about the importance of trying things as we transitioned into the next phase of our lives, but more importantly, the lessons to be learned from trying and failing.</p>
        <p class="tab wrap">Even now in high school, the chance to try something new and venture out of my comfort zone excites me. Through pushing my limits and seeking to always improve myself, I have found passions that I hope I will continue to pursue for the rest of my life. I greatly enjoy time spent outdoors, whether it be playing basketball with my friends, gardening, or going hiking with my brother. Music has also been a very large part of my life, and although it was certainly a struggle at first, I found that the more effort I put in, the more I enjoyed myself. After realizing this, I opted to try flute, and ventured more into singing as well. Once I started to apply this to every aspect of my life, I began to see changes in my perspective of the world, making new and long lasting relationships with others, and discovering just how much joy you can find in the world. As I began to discover more about myself, I found that I was able to communicate with others comfortably and effectively, and I developed my compassionate side, finding volunteer opportunities such as soup kitchens or gift wrappings where I could give back some of the joy I had found. I also began to mature as a leader, being able to guide my peers while understanding their needs, helping them grow in their own abilities and skills, understanding the importance of leading by example, and also learning when to lead, and when to step back. With children, I find myself at home, being able to entertain them for hours on end, continuing to explore the little kid in me. As I begin on this new path towards a career in web design, I am excited to see what the future holds for me.</p>
