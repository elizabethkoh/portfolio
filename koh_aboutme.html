        <p class="tab wrap">Welcome to my website! I am Elizabeth Koh, a junior at Dublin High School who would like to pursue a career either in architecture, electrical engineering, or computer science. As a part of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy (DEDA), I am currently taking AP Computer Science Applications, where we learn the basics of programming in java. I enjoy creating things with my own hands, and believe that innovation is essential to progress in how we live and interact with each other. I hope to study Architecture as an undergraduate, then go to dental school and study to become a pediatric dentist.</p>
        <p class="tab wrap">In terms of extracurriculars and school involvement, I try to involve myself in a variety of academic and creative activities. I have been a part of Gael Force Robotics, our school robotics team, for three years now, first on competition teams and now as the captain of my own team, 5327S. As a captain, I organize and head the development process, teaching my teammates what I know about building and coding while connecting with them and learning from their new perspectives. I also joined our school's Girls' Lacrosse Team in my freshman year, playing on the JV team and then on the Varsity team as a junior. I hope to continue playing for my last two years of high school, and want to work hard to improve my offensive play. Earlier this year, while I was still a sophomore, I also took part in the Alameda County Science and Engineering Fair, creating a low-cost hearing device with user customization to address the inaccessibility  of professional grade hearing aids. With my project and through my judging interviews, I won a Chevron award, an award from the Navy, a category first place award, and a Grand Award, which qualified me to the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, held in May. I was able to meet a lot of fellow competitors and also attend guest speaker talks, virtually of course, and won an award from the United States Air Force, as well as fourth place in my category. Since the summer of 202, I have also been doing privately contracted work for my father, which mainly encompasses building custom Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and helping with miscellaneous soldering jobs. This past summer, I interned at Newark Dental Center, acting as assistant to each of the 3 dentists over the course of several weeks. It was such a valuable experience to meet all the welcoming and friendly people who work there, and it helped me discover that I really like interacting with the patients, as well as working with my hands and learning new skills. I hope to be able to intern with my current dentist as well, since they are a pediatric practice, which I hope to specialize in as a dentist. So far in my junior year, my favorite class is Sculpture and Ceramics, which provides a creative break from my more academically rigorous classes, and allows my to create beautiful things with my hands.</p>
        <p class="tab wrap">I greatly enjoy time spent outdoors, whether it be swimming in lakes with my sister, gardening, or going hiking with my brother. I also love playing sports with my friends, whether it be an impromptu volleyball match, pickup basketball, tossing a frisbee around, or anything active and involving friendly competition. Music has always been a very large part of my life, and although piano in particular was certainly a struggle at first, I found that the more effort I put in, the more I enjoyed myself. After realizing this, I began playing more songs which I found beautiful and which I could immerse myself in, and found that not only did I learn to love the piano, but I also greatly improved in my skill. After that, I opted to try flute, and ventured more into singing as well. I love reading, but unfortunately, I feel as though my schedule does not leave me with much time to pursue this. My favorite authors are Charlotte Bronte and Kazuo Ishiguro, and CS Lewis, though I have yet to read all their books. I also enjoy baking, sewing, crocheting, knitting, and embroidery in my free time. I absolutely love children and their antics, and volunteer weekly at my church's outreach program to teach kindergarteners.</p>
