              <p class = "tab wrap">As a part of the Engineering Academy, I have been provided with many opportunities to explore different fields of engineering through mentorship, field trips, and guest speakers.</p>
              <p class = "tab wrap">As a junior in the Engineering Academy, I was given the opportunity to participate in the mentorship program. My mentor was Brock Davis, a Control Systems Engineer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Throughout the year, I was able to recieve advice and wisdom from him about college, how to interact well with others, and how to manage time spent on work and also relaxation.</p>
              <p class = "tab wrap"> I have also participated in field trips and attended talks by both industry professionals and by Dublin High School Alumni. Through these various opportunities, I have been able to learn more about specific industries and jobs, and learned from the experiences of undergraduate students in a variety of subject matters. I am immensely grateful to Ms. Chou, Mr. Brown, and all the other teachers who take the effort to organize these field trips and talks for us.</p>
        <p class = "tab wrap">Below is a summary of the various guest speaker talks and field trips I have attended.</p>

            <p>Through this talk, I was able to learn more about the risk-taking, resilience, and versatility required to be a sucessful entrepreneur. Mr. Morris talked to us about his own experiences as a tech industrialist, explaining his view on entrepreneurship, the skills necessary for it, and more.

            <p class="proj-details">Field Trip<br>2022</p>
            <p>For this field trip, I visited the Dig Deep Farms to learn about sustainible argriculture. The farmers there taught us about the mutualistic relationship between different plants in beneficial hedgerows, cover crops, mother gardens, and more. I was able to learn a lot about how they have been trying to grow their crops in as natural and enviornmentally friendly ways as possible.

            <p>Through this guest speaker talk, I was able to learn more about Aerospace Engineering from Ms. Morse, who has studied both Materials Science and Engineering, as well as Aerospace Engineering. Although I do not intend to go into aerospace or adjacent fields, I found her description of her work on projects at Lockheed Martin and Yosemite Space very interesing.</p>

            <p>We were led around by Ms. Zavadil on a virtual tour, being shown each step in the treatment process. I found it amazing how each step further purified the water, and how free energy from one process was used to power another process, to keep the treament plant as self sustaining and environmentally friendly as possible.</p>

            <p class="proj-details">Alumni Guest Speaker<br>2020</p>
            <p>I found her talk very interesting and also very relavent to myself. We shared a lot of the same activities and interests in high school, both being very involved in the Gael Force Robotics club. Since she was also majoring in Architectural Desgin, which I am interested in, I also gained a lot of insight from her about what her classes and learning consisted of. I related to her sentiments about work ethic and interests in building miniature models, and overall felt inspired and understood at the end of her talk.</p>
