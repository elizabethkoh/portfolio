            <h2>Board Game Project</h2>
            <p class="proj-details">AP Computer Science Applications<br>July 18 - August 30, 2021<br>Group Project (three people)</p>
            <p>For the duration of this project, I worked with two other group members to design, program, and test algorithms to implement functionality in a two player board game. There were several requirements we had to fulfil, such as having question cards pop up when players landed on special tiles, as well as a using two dice and requiring players to roll the exact number of spaces to reach the end. In order to maximize our progress and streamline our workflow, we first delegated tasks, then had those who finished early double down on the tasks which were taking longer. We organized a lot of team meetings, where we could try and work through issues together, and worked individually in the interim. As the lead programmer, I worked on the main algorithms for movement, incorporating logic to test and account for taking shortcuts and moving backwards. I also restructured the program to incorporate turns between players and clarify how the value of the dice roll was returned and used.

            <p>For the duration of this project, I worked with three other group members to design and test a bridge that would be both stable and cost effective. This meant researching various bridge designs and materials, and using the Bridge Designer 2016 Software in order to virtually construct a stable bridge by choosing the material and cross sections of various truss members. Our design would also have to withstand a load test of trucks driving across. In order to accomplish this, we worked individually to come up with our own brainstormed designs, then followed a Decision Matrix to determine which design would be the most promising. As the Project Manager, I worked on setting meeting times and goals, delegating tasks, and keeping track of our progress in relation to our deadlines. I also helped to make modifications to our chosen design with the goal of reducing member compression forces.

            <h2>Upcycling Project</h2>
            <p class="proj-details">Principles of Engineering<br>February 10 - March 4, 2021<br>Group Project (three people)</p>
            <p>For the duration of this project, I worked with two other group members to create a product line that would address both a real-world issue and the growing recyclable waste in landfills. Our product line uses a variety of materials, from plastic cups to soda cans, lightbulbs, and twine. With the successful production and marketing of our product line, we could take a big step towards reducing these numbers, keeping harmful waste out of our landfills and oceans by repurposing them. Not only that, but each plant holder sold is another plant being cultivated and nurtured, which can further a love for nature and possibly even help regenerate our natural ecosystems. Our products can be used for years and years, even after they have served their original purpose and housed many generations of plants, thereby greatly reducing their harmful and toxic presence in our environment, while providing fresh oxygen in your room or outside. This project taught me the importance of communication, as creating such a product line requried a lot of joint effort. This was especially hard to coordinate online, as we had to arrange meetings outside of class, and we constantly found ourselves pushing milestone back simply because we did not have time.

            <h2>Painted Pictures - MIT App Inventor</h2>
            <p class="proj-details">Computer Science Principles<br>September 23 - October 9, 2019<br>Partner Project</p>
            <p>For the duration of this project, I worked with a classmate to create a fully functioning Photo Booth App with an added feature of our choice - a feature that allowed you to draw on any given picture. In this project, I worked a lot on troubleshooting, as this project had by far the most issues. Our main problem was regarding how to transport images across different screens, which was very complicated and which we could not find a way to fix. It was  a good opportunity to learn to ask for help, as when we asked our course teacher how to transport multiple pieces of data, he suggested using a Tiny Database, which got us a lot farther than before. However, because we hadn't given ourselves enough time to work out all the bugs, we ended up rearranging all of the features on a single screen, which took a long time, but ultimately worked out. This provided a valuable lesson in time management and looking ahead, as well as the importance of leaving a little extra time before the actual deadline, so that if things don't go as planned, there is still more time to figure it out. As a result of the many problems we faced, it became absolutely necessary to have constant communication, updating each other on successes as well as setbacks, and always working out a schedule for home and weekends. I was also active in documenting our progress and commenting our code to make it understandable to anyone who was reading it. This project was a useful experience in working with deadlines and building good communication habits.

            <p>Created overnight by a team of three, The Right Skin is a product searcher that caters to your skin type, finding products that have beneficial and eco friendly ingredients. My main role in this project was to rearrange the web elements in a more organized fashion, as well as orchestrating our group's general efforts and setting targets, as well as overseeing the general effect and aesthetic of the website. Another big part of how I contributed was with troubleshooting. Since our group as a whole was relatively new to HTML and CSS, we conducted a lot of research about elements such as radio buttons. A lot of the time, these additions would not work, and it would be up to me to do more research, and experiment with that problem until I was able to get it to work. Not only was it hard for us to write and debug our code, but we also had to work under extremely rushed circumstances, considering we had a little over 19 hours to complete our project, and a presentation to boot. Although the website remains unfinished, this project provided me with a much needed and much appreciated opportunity to experience firsthand what it was like to code and design an interactive website. My view of web development had previously been very limited, but I was able to boost my learning of HTML and CSS because of this project.

            <h2>A Small Story - Scratch</h2>
          <p class="proj-details">Computer Science Principles<br>September 3 - 11, 2019<br>Partner Project</p>
            <p>In this project, I worked alongside a partner to program an interactive story using Scratch. With this being my first project related to programming, it helped me learn the importance of setting your own checkpoints and communications, and the importance of creativity when working around problems. As I was working with my partner, we would come across many problems regarding the character sprites and would have to decide which of the various possible methods would be most efficient for each part of the story. Halfway through the project, my partner and I discovered that instead of using broadcasts to program messages between characters, we could simply use "wait" blocks to time their conversations. This proved to be quite a common theme throughout our project, and in most cases we decided that taking the extra effort to redo what we had previously done would ultimately save us a lot more time and effort. These setbacks would affect our progress towards certain milestones, and so every time one of us encountered a problem, we would immediately let the other know. This way, we could work together to try and solve the problem, and if necessary, rearrange our projected milestones. Throughout the course of the project, I mainly worked on visual effects, creating new sprites when necessary, and would also help to fully and continually document our progress.
