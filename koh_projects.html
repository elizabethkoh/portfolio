            <h2>Painted Pictures - MIT App Inventor</h2>
            <p class="proj-details">Computer Science Principles<br>September 23 - October 9, 2019<br>Partner Project</p>
            <p>For the duration of this project, I worked with a classmate to create a fully functioning Photo Booth App with an added feature of our choice - a feature that allowed you to draw on any given picture. In this project, I worked a lot on troubleshooting, as this project had by far the most issues. Our main problem was regarding how to transport images across different screens, which was very complicated and which we could not find a way to fix. It was  a good opportunity to learn to ask for help, as when we asked our course teacher how to transport multiple pieces of data, he suggested using a Tiny Database, which got us a lot farther than before. However, because we hadn't given ourselves enough time to work out all the bugs, we ended up rearranging all of the features on a single screen, which took a long time, but ultimately worked out. This provided a valuable lesson in time management and looking ahead, as well as the importance of leaving a little extra time before the actual deadline, so that if things don't go as planned, there is still more time to figure it out. As a result of the many problems we faced, it became absolutely necessary to have constant communication, updating each other on successes as well as setbacks, and always working out a schedule for home and weekends. I was also active in documenting our progress and commenting our code to make it understandable to anyone who was reading it. This project was a useful experience in working with deadlines and building good communication habits.

            <p class="proj-details">Digitize II Hackathon<br>September 28 - 29, 2019<br>Group Project (three people)</p>
            <p>Created overnight by a team of three, The Right Skin is a product searcher that caters to your skin type, finding products that have beneficial and eco friendly ingredients. My main role in this project was to rearrange the web elements in a more organized fashion, as well as orchestrating our group's general efforts and setting targets, as well as overseeing the general effect and aesthetic of the website. Another big part of how I contributed was with troubleshooting. Since our group as a whole was relatively new to HTML and CSS, we conducted a lot of research about elements such as radio buttons. A lot of the time, these additions would not work, and it would be up to me to do more research, and experiment with that problem until I was able to get it to work. Not only was it hard for us to write and debug our code, but we also had to work under extremely rushed circumstances, considering we had a little over 19 hours to complete our project, and a presentation to boot. Although the website remains unfinished, this project provided me with a much needed and much appreciated opportunity to experience firsthand what it was like to code and design an interactive website. My view of web development had previously been very limited, but I was able to boost my learning of HTML and CSS because of this project.

          <p class="proj-details">Computer Science Principles<br>September 3 - 11, 2019<br>Partner Project</p>
            <p>In this project, I worked alongside a partner to program an interactive story using Scratch. With this being my first project related to programming, it helped me learn the importance of setting your own checkpoints and communications, and the importance of creativity when working around problems. As I was working with my partner, we would come across many problems regarding the character sprites and would have to decide which of the various possible methods would be most efficient for each part of the story. Halfway through the project, my partner and I discovered that instead of using broadcasts to program messages between characters, we could simply use "wait" blocks to time their conversations. This proved to be quite a common theme throughout our project, and in most cases we decided that taking the extra effort to redo what we had previously done would ultimately save us a lot more time and effort. These setbacks would affect our progress towards certain milestones, and so every time one of us encountered a problem, we would immediately let the other know. This way, we could work together to try and solve the problem, and if necessary, rearrange our projected milestones. Throughout the course of the project, I mainly worked on visual effects, creating new sprites when necessary, and would also help to fully and continually document our progress.
