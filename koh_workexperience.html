        <p class = "tab wrap">As a part of the Engineering Academy, I’ve been able to listen to many different guest speakers, and through them have been able to gain some insight into various professions. One such speaker, John Stewart, spoke to us about his experience working with CISCO. He emphasized the constant challenge to stay ahead of possible attackers, and told us many interesting stories about some of the biggest cyber attacks, the development of cybersecurity, and how he first began to code. Another speaker that really stood out to me this year was Aileen Iniguez, who’s own journey to her position in Chevron really inspired me, especially considering that she is a first generation college graduate. She is a strong advocate for herself and others, and she shared how her experiences with Techbridge Girls shaped and prepared her for her future. I deeply admire her character and her resilience, and I am so thankful for all the guest speakers we have been able to have this year.</p>
        <p class = "tab wrap">I volunteer regularly at my church, through programs like Vacation Bible School (VBS), and a Friday night program called AWANA. I attended these programs when I was younger, and they have been a crucial part in shaping me and have been the source of many happy memories. Now that I’ve graduated from these programs, I have begun to volunteer with them, because I want to be a part of giving back and being able to change these children’s lives. Every Friday night, I help children memorize Bible verses, teach them lessons, prepare snacks for them, and play games with them. I’ve taught children from as young as preschool to 3rd grade, and I’ve made so many special bonds with them. I also help out every summer with VBS, where I am usually a song leader and a teacher’s assistant. Along with some other friends, I help lead the kids in song and dance, which can require many rehearsals weeks before the camp. The first two years I’ve helped with VBS, I would help a main teacher, but this past summer, due to a shortage of volunteers, I ended up in charge of teaching and engaging probably the hardest group to manage - the Kindergarteners. It was a wonderful experience, and I enjoyed myself immensely, having learnt a lot about communication, thorough preparation, and time management.</p>
