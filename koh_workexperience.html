        <p class = "tab wrap">As a part of the Engineering Academy, I have been provided with many opportunities to participate in field trips and to attend talks by both industry professionals and by Dublin High School Alumni. Through these various opportunities, I have been able to learn more about specific industries and jobs, and learned from the experiences of undergraduate students in a variety of subject matters. I am immensely grateful to Ms. Chou, Mr. Brown, and all the other teachers who take the effort to organize these field trips and talks for us.</p>
        <p class = "tab wrap">Due to the current pandemic, I have only been on one virtual field trip, to the wastewater treatement plant. We were led around by Ms. Zavadil on a virtual tour, being shown each step in the treatment process. I found it amazing how each step further purified the water, and how free energy from one process was used to power another process, to keep the treament plant as self sustaining and environmentally friendly as possible. </p>
        <p class = "tab wrap">I have also been able to listen to many guest speakers who have come to our school and have spoken to us virtually. One of the talks I remember most was from Gary Richter, who spoke about his role as a international security analyst at Sandia National Labs. His stories about his experiences abroad, with ISIS and with other terrorist groups, were immensely exciting, and showed me that there were actually some very interesting jobs related to engineering. However, the opportunity that has impacted me the most was when the Engineering and Design Academy hosted an alumni talk featuring Hanna Li. I found her talk very interesting and also very relavent to myself. We shared a lot of the same activities and interests in high school, both being very involved in the Gael Force Robotics club. Since she was also majoring in Architectural Desgin, which I am interested in, I also gained a lot of insight from her about what her classes and learning consisted of. I related to her sentiments about work ethic and interests in building miniature models, and overall felt inspired and understood at the end of her talk.</p>
        <p class = "tab wrap">As a junior in the Engineering Academy, I was given the opportunity to participate in the mentorship program. My mentor was Brock Davis, a
